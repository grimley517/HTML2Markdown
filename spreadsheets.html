        <p>Spreadsheets are usefull for calculating several things at a time. They are particularly good at generating sense out of complicated situations using numbers.  however care needs to be taken when using a spreadsheet.  In particular often you need to remember that you are the boss, and the computer does as you tell it.</p>

<h1>Aims</h1>

<p>This is an introduction to Spreadsheets.</p>

<p>By the end of this unit you will learn:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Why spreadsheets are used</li>

	<li>How a spreadsheet can be used to create a table</li>

    <li>How spreadsheets can be used to perform many calculations at once</li>

    <li>How to create simple, but effective charts using a spreadsheet.</li>

    <li>When to use a spreadsheet in lessons.</li>

</ul>

<p>Visual Literacy exercise.</p>

<h2>Learning aims:</h2>

<ul>
    <li>To be able to recognize control metaphors.</li>

<li>To learn key terms relating to spreadsheets.</li>
<li>Key words to help you with this exercise:</li>

<ul><li >Row,</li>
    <li> Column,</li>
    <li> Tab,</li>
    <li> Bar, </li>
    <li>Cell,</li>
    <li> Function. </li>
</ul>
</ul>


<p> >Find out and write down the meanings of each of the key words in a
new word document.</p>

<img width=484 height=127 src="y8Spreadsheets/image002.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_s1026">
<p>Firstly open Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>Looking at the blank spreadsheet in front of you answer the following questions:</p>

<img width=62 height=34
 src="y8Spreadsheets/image004.gif" >
<p>What options are are available under the file menu in excel?</p>

<p> Are there any that are different from the file menu in a blank
Microsoft Word document?</p>

<img width=230 height=183 src="y8Spreadsheets/image006.gif" >
<p> "C6" represents the location of the current cell.</p>

<p> What does the "C" represent?</p>

<p> What does the "6"represent?</p>

<img width=484 height=15 src="y8Spreadsheets/image008.gif">
<p>Look at this bar.</p>

<p> What is it called? (hint hover your mouse over the selector at the
end and it will tell you)</p>

<p> What does the button do?</p>

<h1> Activity 2</h1>

<p> The science experiment - Guided learning activity.</p>


<h2>Learning aim:</h2>

<p>To be able to create various types of graphs of sufficient quality
for use in other learning areas.</p>



<p>Alison was conducting a science experiment to find out how
temperature affected the amount of salt that would dissolve in 100 ml of water.</p>



<p>She recorded her results in a table like this.</p>



<table >
 <thead>
  <tr >
   <th >
   Temperature (C)
   </th>
   <th>
   Amount of salt dissolved
   </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tr >
  <td >30 </td>
  <td >15g</td>
 </tr>
 <tr >
  <td > 40  </td>
  <td > 22g  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr >
  <td > 50  </td>
  <td > 29g </td>
 </tr>
 <tr >
  <td > 60  </td>
  <td > 35g  </td>
 </tr>
 <tr >
  <td > 70  </td>
  <td > 43g </td>
 </tr>
</table>



<p>Where did Alison write the units for her independant variable (the
Temperature)?</p>

<p>Where did Alison write the units for her dependant variable?</p>

<p>Which column shows the better way of recording the units used?
Explain why?</p>

<p>Open up a spreadsheet and record Alison´s Results.</p>

<img width=285 height=165 src="y8Spreadsheets/image012.gif"/>
<p>Your spreadsheet should look like this.</p>


<p>Select the insert tab, and highlight your data.</p>

<img width=263 height=200 src="y8Spreadsheets/image014.gif" />

<p>We are going to start by making a scatter graph.</p>

<p>This can be done by clicking the scatter graph in the ribbon once
your data has been set up.</p>

<img width=450 height=282 src="y8Spreadsheets/image016.gif" />
<p>You are now going to make this scatter graph look great by doing the
following. (hint everything for this is now in the chart options (highlighted
green in the ribbon))</p>

<p>Removing the legend (you don´t need a legend when you only have one line.)</p>

<p>Label the
axes (Temperature (degrees C)) and (amount of salt dissolved (g))</p>

<p>Change the temperature axis so that it only goes down to 20.</p>

<p>Make the chart appear, in its own tab.</p>

<p>Your chart should look like this at the end;</p>

<img width=450 height=282 src="y8Spreadsheets/image018.gif">
<p>Make a pie chart, a bar chart and a column hart for Alisons data. </p>

<p>Copy and paste all of your charts, into a word document, size them
appropriately so that they take up no more than half the page width. Then for each chart explain whether it
is an appropriate graphic for the results of not, and explain why.</p>
    
<p>Upload the word document with your answers on.</p>

<h1 >Activity 3</h1>

<p>Running.</p>

<p>Another group of students did a PE practical. </p>

<h2>Learning aim</h2>

<p>To be able to use simple formulae in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>They looked up the winners of last years running competitions and
plotted their winners times</p>

<img src="y8Spreadsheets/image020.gif" />
<p>Using the times given here, find out the speeds they were
running at. and the average running speed in meters per second for all the
winners.</p>

<p>You may find the following formula helpful;</p>

<p>distance = speed * time.</p>

<h2 >Questions</h2>

<p>Which symbol is always used to start an equation in a spreadsheet function?</p>

<p>What is the symbol used in a spreadsheet function for finding the <strong>sum</strong> of two numbers?</p>

<p>What is the symbol used in a spreadsheet function for finding the <strong>difference</strong> between two numbers?</p>

<p>What is the symbol used in a spreadsheet function for finding the <strong>product</strong> of two numbers?</p>

<p>What is the symbol used in a spreadsheet for finding the <strong>quotient</strong> of two
numbers?</p>

<p>What is thesymbol used in a spreadsheet for raising a number to an <strong>index</strong>?</p>

<p>Which of the above symbols are the same as you use in Maths lessons and which are different?</p>

<p>Is the average speed of all the runners a helpful statistic?</p>

<p>Upload your spreadsheet, and a word document with your answers on.</p>

		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li> Enter the data into a spreadsheet.</li>
			<li>Create an extra column. Entitle it "Body mass index"</li>
			<li> The algorithm for working out a persons body mass index is:
				<ul>
					<li>Square their height in m</li>
					<li>Divide their weight in kg by the previous answer</li>
					<li>Return the answer to the previous step as their body mass index</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Change the algorithm into a formula and work out the body mass index for each person in the table</li>
			<li>Create </li>
		</ol>
